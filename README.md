# Scraper
Just a basic script made with Python to scrape a Google search of a designated queried area to output simple weather information. Nothing too complex, just something to help me get my feet wet with Github and importing projects.


The script is designed mainly to run from my computer, specifically from the Visual Studio Code program, I cannot guarantee it to be functional elsewhere as I do not intend to clean it up for public use. This was purely a project to introduce myself to Visual Studio, getting used to Github, and learning more about Python.
