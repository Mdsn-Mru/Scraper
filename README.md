# Scraper
Just a basic script made with Python to scrape a Google search of a designated queried area to output simple weather information. Nothing too complex, just something to help me get my feet wet with GitHub and importing projects.


To use the script, ensure you can run Python scripts on your computer. Then it's as simple as replacing what's in the query field on line 7 with the location you wish to scrape the weather data from. Run the script and you should be good to go!
